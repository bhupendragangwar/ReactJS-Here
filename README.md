## ðŸ“– About

This repository is created for the purpose of **step-by-step learning of ReactJS**.  
It includes code snippets, exercises, and real-world project examples to help you gain production-ready skills in React development.  
I provide  a mega list of ReactJS questions (Beginner â†’ Advanced), mapped directly to the roadmap I shared. If you can answer these confidently, youâ€™ll be interview-ready and able to build production-level apps.

# Course requirements or prerequisites
- JavaScript + HTML + CSS fundamentals are absolutely required
- ES6+ JavaScript knowledge is beneficial but not a must-have
- NO prior React or any other JS framework experience is required!

## Learning Phase

### Phase 1: React Fundamentals (Beginner)
- What is React? Why use it?
- Setting up React (Vite, CRA, Next.js basics)
- JSX (syntax, expressions, attributes, children)
- Components (Function vs Class)
- Props (passing data between components)
- State (useState hook basics)
- Event handling in React
- Conditional rendering
- Lists & keys in React
- Controlled vs Uncontrolled components
- Forms handling (inputs, checkboxes, selects)
- Component lifecycle (Class lifecycle methods + equivalent Hooks)

### Phase 2: Core React Concepts (Intermediate)
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, useMemo, useCallback, useReducer)
- Custom Hooks (building reusable logic)
- Context API (global state without props drilling)
- Error boundaries
- React Router (navigation, dynamic routes, nested routes)
- Performance optimization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- React DevTools (debugging components)
- Fragments & Portals
- Lifting state up
- Code splitting & lazy loading (React.lazy, Suspense)

### Phase 3: State Management (Intermediate â†’ Advanced)
- Local state vs global state
- Context API vs Redux vs Zustand vs Recoil
- Redux (actions, reducers, store, middleware)
- Redux Toolkit (RTK Query, slices, async thunks)
- Async data handling (fetch API, Axios in React, error handling)
- Server state management (TanStack Query / React Query)
- `Token Management, & Session Maintain, Cookies`

### Phase 4: Advanced React (Pro Level)
- React 18 features (Automatic batching, Concurrent rendering, useTransition, useDeferredValue)
- React Fiber architecture (basic understanding)
- Higher Order Components (HOC)
- Render props pattern
- Compound components pattern
- Controlled vs Uncontrolled advanced cases
- Authentication & Authorization in React (JWT, sessions)
- Performance profiling & optimization
- Unit testing in React (Jest, React Testing Library)
- End-to-End testing (Cypress, Playwright)

### Phase 5: Ecosystem & Real-World Production (Mastery)
- Next.js (SSR, SSG, ISR, API routes)
- TypeScript with React
- Styling in React (CSS Modules, Styled-components, Tailwind, shadcn/ui)
- Component libraries (Material UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI, Radix UI)
- File structure & scalable architecture
- React + Backend integration (REST APIs, GraphQL, WebSockets)
- Error monitoring & logging (Sentry, LogRocket)
- Deployment (Vercel, Netlify, AWS, Docker)
- CI/CD for React apps (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
